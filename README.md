I started off working on the brute force algorithm and it wasn't too bad because we went over the algorithm in class and the concept isn't too difficult to grasp. I did run into a few blocks smoothing out the input to pass into the functions, like taking out characters and inputs with too many arguments, etc. I eventually figured it out by googling. Most of the stuff I had to refer to stackoverflow is commented in my code. Starting the basic implementation was a little bit more difficult. Professor Suri did a great job teaching the algorithm in class and I understood that I had to divide the list and recursively find the minimum in each list. One difficulty I ran into when implementing this part was being able to pass and recover TOGETHER, both the points AND the min distance. I ended up using a list of tuples. The next part was the strip part which was also a little more difficult to understand. I went to Neeraj's office hours and got clarification. The part that confused me the most was the sorting by y-coordinate and the basic and optimized implementations differed because of that.
